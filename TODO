Erik's TODO list for the next release:

    1) Finish up the reentrancy auditing
    2) Better configuration system (CML1 + kbuild + menuconfig)
    3) When fixing the config system, ensure that _every_ option 
	that is enabled or disabled is listed in uClibc_config.h
    4) When options are disabled, also disable them in the
	include files as well.
    5) Make all small objects (>~50 bytes) into either inlines or
	into a static library
    6) Rework code that fails POSIX conformance tests

Other random things:

    *) Rework code that fails POSIX conformance tests
    *) Document all differences between the feature set of uClibc 
	and glibc.
    *) Add missing syscall() function to allow arbitraty syscalls 
	to be made. 
    *) Fix profiling support
    *) pwrite64 and pread64



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manuel's todo:

Test ungetwc.
Implement %lc (%C) and %ls (%S) handling for printf.
Implement grouping support and locale-specific radix.
Deal with mb format string issues in printf, scanf, strftime (at least).
Implement wide formatted output.
Reimplement scanf for narrow and wide streams.
Implement any other missing standard functions from wchar.h.
Improve customization of the new stdio code.
Clean up locale code and make it easier to build.  (Fix alt_digits!)
Add collation support (initally for 8-bit locales) and implement strxfrm and strcoll.
Reimlement strerror and strsignal.
tzfile?
era support in strftime/strptime?

Reimplement _dtostr to correct its deficiencies (%A support!) and hopefully reduce its size.

Revisit the unified syscall stuff which has been broken for a while now.

Older stuff...

Move the target-specific sysconf.c generator to extra (as it needs to be
	run on the target) and fix libc/unistd/Makefile.

Add a usage message to the gcc wrapper.

Make errno and endptr handling the default in the strto* functions and
	document how to turn those off to save space.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ds's list:

Search for string literals that are not in the .rodata section.  (Varies
by architecture and gcc version.)

man pages for binaries

add obstack stuff for gettext (?)

check compiling without FP support -- are FP instructions still generated?
Needs a uClibc_config.h entry dependent on HAS_FLOATING_POINT.

Why does ld.so search /usr/powerpc-uclibc/lib before LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any takers?

*) Fix regex so it isn't so stinking big
*) Fix glob so it isn't so stinking big
*) Documentation
	- List all differences between the feature set of uClibc and glibc.
*) run 'nm -D --size-sort -t d libuClibc-0.9.5.so' and work on the biggest things 
	(i.e. stuff at the end of the list) to make them smaller.
*) make inb/outb work for all arches.  This is complete for i386 and arm.  
	Other archs like powerpc, still need fixing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

PORTING
-------

bits/dirent.h currently differs from the glibc version (d_type unsupported)

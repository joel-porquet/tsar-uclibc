Any takers?

On ARM, the kernel fp math emulator uses a funky byte ordering
    that causes some of our math functions to produce bad results.
    We need to fix up the things for the wierd ARM byte ordering.
Fix regex so it isn't so stinking big
Fix glob so it isn't so stinking big
Integrate Jeff Garzik's key-value reading code for pwd/grp, /etc/hosts, etc
Finish sparc port

Better configuration system
run 'nm -D --size-sort -t d libuClibc-0.9.5.so' and work on the biggest things 
    (i.e. stuff at the end of the list) to make them smaller.
make inb/outb work (for lilo et all)
	update: done for i386 and arm.  lilo and the pcmcia tools compile cleanly now
include/resolv.h does not define struct _res, and libc/inet/resolv.c
    does not use this struct.  res_init does nothing.  the other res_* 
    functions are not implemented.
scandir.c doesn't check returns on malloc and realloc.
Add in shadow support (include/shadow.h and such)
Right now, getopt has different behavior when dynamically vs when
    statically linked, violating the principle of least surprise.

Split the math library, such that by default we only build C89
    math functions, i.e.: acos asin atan atan2 ceil cos cosh exp 
    fabs floor fmod frexp ldexp log log10 modf pow sin sinh sqrt 
    tan tanh

Manuel's unsorted todo:

Move the target-specific sysconf.c generator to extra (as it needs to be
	run on the target) and fix libc/unistd/Makefile.

Add a usage message to the gcc wrapper.

Look at pre-cephes-addition floating point code and possibly rework.
	(primarily nan and infinity handling)

Make scanf and strtod aware of nan and inf.

Add overflow error-checking to fread and fwrite.

Document uClibc-specific extensions I know of or have implemented.
	binary string conversion for printf
	malloc-less stdio
	optional printf unconfigured-for-type error messages

Add binary string conversion to scanf to mirror printf?

Teach scanf about (nil) for %p.

What to do about %m in printf?

Make errno and endptr handling the default in the strto* functions and
	document how to turn those off to save space.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ds's list:

Search for string literals that are not in the .rodata section.  (Varies
by architecture.)

man pages for binaries

add basename() and dirname() for gettext

add obstack stuff for gettext (?)

setjmp() on powerpc

getaddrinfo()

PORTING
-------

bits/dirent.h currently differs from the glibc version (d_type unsupported)

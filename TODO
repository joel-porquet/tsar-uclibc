Erik's TODO list for the next release:

    *) Implement getgrgid_r and getgrnam_r, per SuSv3 
    *) When options are disabled, also disable them in the
	include files as well.
    *) Make all configured out symbols optionally add a linker warning saying
	"Hey!  You are trying to use a function that you have configured out.  
	If you really want to use this function, enable CONFIG_FOO and rebuild
	uClibc".
    *) Make all small objects (>~50 bytes) into either inlines or
	into a static library
    *) Document all differences between the feature set of uClibc 
	and glibc.
    *) Fix regex so it isn't so stinking big
    *) Fix glob so it isn't so stinking big
    *)  Fix the dlopen() bug with handling of symbols that are already
	resolved.  Seems if it is already resolved it ignores them rather than
	resolving the new symbol and overriding.
    *) Adapt uClibc to use Linux 2.5.x pthreads

Manuel's todo:

I'm currently working on completing the wide char and locale support.

  1) Little things that need fixing:
  ----------------------------------
  a) Fix the ctype support for 8-bit locales.
  b) Fix bug in *printf: outdigit precison bug
  c) Check that gnu/bsd extension members tm_gmtoff and tm_zone in struct tm
     are respected where they should be.
  d) Implement the obstack printf funcs for glibc compat.
  e) Implement glibc 'a' flag for scanf string conversions.
  f) Allow use of the older non-table-based ctype functions when using
     stub locale support. (smaller)
  
  2) Additional str{f|p}time issues.
  ----------------------------------
  a) Spacing issue wrt strptime.
  b) Support locale specific alternate digits.  (data is in place)
  c) Support locale era in year designations.   (data is in place)
  d) Deal with mb format string issues in strftime.
  e) Implement wcsftime.
  
  3) Other locale issues (my implementation):
  -------------------------------------------
  a) Do a little more clean up of ctype and wctype.
  b) Rework of the locale data organization to make using locales reasonable
     when staticly linking.  (mmap)
  c) Rewrite the locale data generation tools to process the text specifications
     rather than relying on glibc.
  d) Adapt regex lib to use my collation data and add the necessary collating
     item tables to support SUSv3 required features.
  e) transliteration of unsupported wchars in 8-bit locales (like glibc).
  f) Support ISO/IEC 14652 draft locale extensions (LC_PAPER, etc).
  g) Implement strfrom.
  h) Shift-state codeset locale support?


Other stuff:

Move the target-specific sysconf.c generator to extra (as it needs to be
	run on the target) and fix libc/unistd/Makefile.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ds's list:

Search for string literals that are not in the .rodata section.  (Varies
by architecture and gcc version.)

man pages for binaries

add obstack stuff for gettext (?)

check compiling without FP support -- are FP instructions still generated?
Needs a uClibc_config.h entry dependent on HAS_FLOATING_POINT.

Why does ld.so search /usr/powerpc-uclibc/lib before LD_LIBRARY_PATH?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any takers?

*) Documentation
	- List all differences between the feature set of uClibc and glibc.
*) run 'nm -D --size-sort -t d libuClibc-0.9.5.so' and work on the biggest things 
	(i.e. stuff at the end of the list) to make them smaller.
*) make inb/outb work for all arches.  This is complete for i386 and arm.  
	Other archs like powerpc, still need fixing.

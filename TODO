Any takers?

Fix regex so it isn't so stinking big

Integrate Jeff Garzik's key-value reading code for pwd/grp, /etc/hosts, etc
Get the arm port of the shared lib loader working
Get the powerpc port of the shared lib loader working
Finish sparc port
Standardize the style of the header files.

Better configuration system
run 'nm -D --size-sort -t d libuClibc-0.9.5.so' and work on the biggest things 
    (i.e. stuff at the end of the list) to make them smaller.
make inb/outb work (for lilo et all)
	update: done for i386.  lilo and the pcmcia tools compile cleanly now
include/resolv.h does not define struct _res, and libc/inet/resolv.c
    does not use this struct.  res_init does nothing.  the other res_* 
    functions are not implemented.
scandir.c doesn't check returns on malloc and realloc.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Manuel's unsorted todo:

Move the target-specific sysconf.c generator to extra (as it needs to be
	run on the target) and fix libc/unistd/Makefile.

Add a usage message to the gcc wrapper.

Look at pre-cephes-addition floating point code and possibly rework.
	(primarily nan and infinity handling)

Make scanf and strtod aware of nan and inf.

Add overflow error-checking to fread and fwrite.

Document uClibc-specific extensions I know of or have implemented.
	binary string conversion for printf
	malloc-less stdio
	optional printf unconfigured-for-type error messages

Add binary string conversion to scanf to mirror printf?

Teach scanf about (nil) for %p.

What to do about %m in printf?

Make errno and endptr handling the default in the strto* functions and
	document how to turn those off to save space.

PORTING

bits/dirent.h currently differs from the glibc version (d_type unsupported)

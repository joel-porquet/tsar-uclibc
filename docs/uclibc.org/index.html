<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, than using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<p>

<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

    <p>
    <li> <b>25 January 2003, uClibc 0.9.17 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.17.  The biggest piece of news with this release, thanks to
    Manuel Novoa's continuing hard work, is that we now have fully standards
    compliant locale support (optional of course).  The support works nicely,
    (though configuring the locales you wish to support is still manual -- a
    task for the next release).  Full locale data for over 300 locales adds
    approximately 250k.  The collation data for all supported locales is
    roughly 180k.  This may seem rather large to some -- but it is much smaller
    than the approximately 40 MB needed by Glibc to provide the same data.  And
    if you don't need it, you can either disable locale support entirely, or
    enable a smaller set of locales. 

    <p>

    This release also fixes <em>lots and lots</em> of bugs.  The arm
    architecture support (I am embarrassed to note) was totally broken in the
    last release, but is now working as expected.   A security problem (a
    buffer overflow in getlogin_r) was fixed.  And there were architecture
    updates across the board (x86, arm, powerpc, cris, h8300, sparc, and mips).
    And of course, this release includes the usual pile of bug fixes.  Many
    thanks for the large number of patches and fixes that were contributed!

    <p>

    Unfortunately, this release is not binary compatible with earlier uClibc
    releases.  As noted as item 3 in <a
    href="downloads/Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt">
    Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt</a>, uClibc does not (yet) attempt to
    ensure binary compatibility across releases.  We will eventually do that
    (once we reach the "1.0" release) but not yet.  A few bugs turned up that
    needed to be fixed, and the only good way to fix them was to change some
    fundamental data structure sizes.  As a result, this release is _NOT_
    binary compatible with earlier releases -- you will need to recompile your
    applications.  The x86, arm, powerpc, and mips architectures (i.e. the
    systems Erik has available in his office for testing) have been tested and
    are known to work following this change.  Other architectures <em>may</em> 
    need additional updates.  Sorry about that, but it had to be done.  

    <p>
    As usual, the 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/uClibc-0.9.17.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">here</a>.
    You might want to download uClibc from the closest 
    <a href="http://kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirror site</a>.
    Just pick the closest mirror site, and then go to 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">
    http://www.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/</a>
    to download uClibc, where XX is your two letter country code.
    <p>


    
    <p>
    <li> <b>25 January 2003, dev system updates, arm image released</b>
    <br>

    A number of additional problems have been fixed and the arm build 
    is now, finally, compiling and working as expected.  As such, 
    I have updated the <a href="ftp://ftp.uclibc.org/uClibc/root_fs_0.9.17-i386.bz2">
    i386 development system image</a>, the 
    <a href="ftp://ftp.uclibc.org/uClibc/root_fs_0.9.17-powerpc.bz2">
    powerpc development system image</a>, and I am also releasing
    upon an unsuspecting world the brand new
    <a href="ftp://ftp.uclibc.org/uClibc/root_fs_0.9.17-arm.bz2">
    arm development system image</a>!  
    Have fun!
    <p>

    All three development system images were compiled and built using the stock
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a> system.  These were also
    built using the (about to be announced in a couple on minutes) uClibc
    0.9.17 release, so if you want to begin compiling and testing stuff with
    uClibc, but you don't feel like spending the _hours_ it takes to download,
    configure, and build your own uClibc based development system -- then you
    may want to download these and give them a try.  They each contain a 100 MB
    ext2 filesystem with everything you need to begin compiling your own
    applications.  I have (at least minimally) tested each of them and verified
    that the included gcc and g++ compilers produce working uClibc linked
    executables.

    <p>
    Oh, and I have also have updated the uClibc/gcc toolchain builders, so
    if you just want a simple uClibc/gcc toolchain, 
    <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/toolchain/">one of these should work for you.</a>
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>10 January 2003, dev system updates, powerpc image released</b>
    <br>

    A few problems showed up in yesterday's development system release
    (adduser was broken, gdb didn't work, libstdc++ shared libs were missing,
    etc).  So I've updated the <a href="ftp://ftp.uclibc.org/uClibc/root_fs_0.9.17-i386.bz2">
    i386 development system image</a> to fix these problems.
    Also, the <a href="ftp://ftp.uclibc.org/uClibc/root_fs_0.9.17-powerpc.bz2">
    powerpc development system image</a> has finally finished compiling
    and is now released upon an unsuspecting world.  Have fun!
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>9 January 2003, uClibc development system released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has been working hard on <a
    href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a> recently, and is pleased to
    offer a full stand-alone uClibc-only development system.  This is an ext2
    filesystem for i386 containing all the development software you need to
    build your own uClibc applications.  With bash, awk, make, gcc, g++,
    autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh, gdb, strace, valgrind,
    busybox, GNU coreutils, and more, this should have pretty much everything
    you need to get started building your own applications linked against
    uClibc.  By using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  A powerpc and an arm version are in progress.  Expect them
    to be released shortly....

    <p>

    The <a href="ftp://ftp.uclibc.org/uClibc/root_fs_0.9.17-i386.bz2">
    uClibc development system is an 18MB bzip2 compressed ext2 filesystem</a>,
    so be prepared to wait if you are on a slow link.  If you wish to have more
    space, you can loop mount it and 'cp -a' the contents to their own
    partition, or do what I did... <EM>WARNING, the following can be very
    dangerous.  Please be sure you know what you are doing before trying this.
    I am not responsible if you lose all your important data.</EM>I had a spare
    hard drive (in my case /dev/hdg but you'll want to adapt this to your own 
    needs), so I partitioned it with a single ext2 partition filling the drive 
    (in my case /dev/hdg1).  Then I ran:<PRE>
    bzcat root_fs_0.9.17-i386.bz2 | dd of=/dev/hdg1
    e2fsck -f /dev/hdg1
    resize2fs -p /dev/hdg1</PRE>

    which overwrote everything on /dev/hdg with the new uClibc devel system,
    and then expanded the filesystem with the uClibc devel system till it
    filled the whole drive.

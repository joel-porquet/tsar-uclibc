<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, than using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

Before asking questions on the uClibc mailing list,
you might want to take a look at the 
<a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>
or 
you might want to search the mailing list archives...

<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

    <li> <b>3 March 2003, uClibc 0.9.19 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.19.  This is once again primarily a bug-fix release.  Several
    critical problems with system calls were fixed, the pthreads library was
    improved, debugging of applications using uClibc's pthreads library is
    now possible (requires gdb 5.3 or newer that is compiled using uClibc),
    and a number of other random fixes are included.  This release retains
    binary compatibility with uClibc 0.9.18 (except for mips, which didn't
    work properly with uClibc 0.9.18 anyways).  Updated development systems
    images compiled with uClibc 0.9.19 will be released shortly.

    <p>
    As usual, the 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.19.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.
    You might want to download uClibc from the closest 
    <a href="http://kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirror site</a>.
    Just pick the closest mirror site, and then go to 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">
    http://www.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/</a>
    to download uClibc, where XX is your two letter country code.

    <li> <b>17 February 2003, development system updates</b>
    <br>

    The uClibc development systems for
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">i386</a>
    and 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,
    and
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-arm.bz2">arm</a>
    have been again updated.  This time around a few broken symlinks
    (one preventing C++ code from compiling) have been fixed, several
    system calls related to uids and gid have been fixed, the powerpc
    system call mechanism has been updated, and GNU tar and GNU grep
    have been added.  gcc, gcc+, ssh, etc are all still included and
    things remain binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.18.
    Have Fun.
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>12 February 2003, development system updates</b>
    <br>

    The uClibc development system has had a number of problems
    fixed, and has been updated for uClibc 0.9.18.  The 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-i386.bz2">i386</a>
    and 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,
    and
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs-arm.bz2">arm</a>
    devel systems are updated and ready to download and use.
    Have Fun.
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>12 February 2003, uClibc 0.9.18 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.18.  This is primarily a bug-fix release, as there were a few
    directory handling problem that could cause application using uClibc 0.9.17
    to either segfault or lose the first character when reading directry names.
    Unfortunately, once again, this release is _NOT_ binary compatible with
    earlier uClibc releases.  I _think this will be the last time (with the
    possible exception of some future changes to our locale support...)

    <p>
    As usual, the 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.18.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.

    to download uClibc, where XX is your two letter country code.
    <p>
    <p>

    <p>
    <li> <b>25 January 2003, uClibc 0.9.17 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.17.  The biggest piece of news with this release, thanks to
    Manuel Novoa's continuing hard work, is that we now have fully standards
    compliant locale support (optional of course).  The support works nicely,
    (though configuring the locales you wish to support is still manual -- a
    task for the next release).  Full locale data for over 300 locales adds
    approximately 250k.  The collation data for all supported locales is
    roughly 180k.  This may seem rather large to some -- but it is much smaller
    than the approximately 40 MB needed by Glibc to provide the same data.  And
    if you don't need it, you can either disable locale support entirely, or
    enable a smaller set of locales. 

    <p>

    This release also fixes <em>lots and lots</em> of bugs.  The arm
    architecture support (I am embarrassed to note) was totally broken in the
    last release, but is now working as expected.   A security problem (a
    buffer overflow in getlogin_r) was fixed.  And there were architecture
    updates across the board (x86, arm, powerpc, cris, h8300, sparc, and mips).
    And of course, this release includes the usual pile of bug fixes.  Many
    thanks for the large number of patches and fixes that were contributed!

    <p>

    Unfortunately, this release is not binary compatible with earlier uClibc
    releases.  As noted as item 3 <a href="downloads/Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt">here</a>, 
    uClibc does not (yet) attempt to
    ensure binary compatibility across releases.  We will eventually do that
    (once we reach the "1.0" release) but not yet.  A few bugs turned up that
    needed to be fixed, and the only good way to fix them was to change some
    fundamental data structure sizes.  As a result, this release is _NOT_
    binary compatible with earlier releases -- you will need to recompile your
    applications.  The x86, arm, powerpc, and mips architectures (i.e. the
    systems Erik has available in his office for testing) have been tested and
    are known to work following this change.  Other architectures <em>may</em> 
    need additional updates.  Sorry about that, but it had to be done.

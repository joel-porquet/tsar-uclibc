<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, than using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<h3>Mailing List Information</h3>

uClibc has a <a href="/lists/uclibc/">mailing list</a>.<br>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

You might want to take a look at the 
<a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>
before asking questions on the mailing list...
    
    
<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

<ul>
    
    <li> <b>11 July 2002, Native uClibc toolchains updated</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released updated native
    uClibc/gcc-3.1 and uClibc/gcc-2.95 toolchains.  These toolchains
    build real gcc cross compilers (i.e. not just a wrapper) and create
    executables linked vs uClibc.  These toolchains have been tested
    and found working on x86, arm, and mmu-less arm.  They should work
    (at least in theory!) for all architectures supported by uClibc.
    <p>

    These toolchains should make it easy to anyone to build uClibc based 
    applications.  <a href="downloads/toolchain/">Source code can be downloaded here</a>. 
    Be aware that much of the needed source code will actually be downloaded on
    demand when you compile things.  To build the toolchain, simply
    grab the source, edit the Makefile to select where you would like
    the toolchain installed, run 'make', and then go watch TV, eat
    dinner, or visit with your friends while it compiles.  It takes
    about 15 minutes for Erik to compile the gcc-3.1 toolchain (w/C++ support)
    on his Athlon XP 1600 (not counting the time it takes to download
    source code).  Your results may vary...
    <p>


    <li> <b>20 June 2002, uClibc 0.9.12 Released</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.12. This release adds an i960 port, an initial alpha port,
    fully working mips shared library support, shared library support fixes
    for on powerpc, and many other improvements.  One very exciting new feature
    is nearly complete locale support, thanks to a lot of hard work by Manuel
    Novoa III.  uClibc's locale support is <em>much</em> smaller than glibc's,
    though it is also slightly less flexible.  This release was delayed by a
    month due to the arrival of a new baby at Erik's house.  For those that
    have been anxiously waiting, this release should certainly be worth the
    wait.  Have fun!
    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.12.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.

    <li> <b>28 May 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.1 toolchain</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting has released source code and a Makefile to build a
    gcc-3.1 toolchain that natively targets uClibc.  Additionally, the
    gcc-3.0.4 and gcc-2.95 toolchains have also been updated.  These toolchains
    make it easy to build uClibc based applications.  Source code can be
    downloaded <a href="downloads/toolchain/">here</a> and is now much smaller,
    since much of the needed binutils and gcc source code is now downloaded on
    demand.  To build the toolchain, simply grab the source, edit the Makefile
    to select where you would like the toolchain installed, and then run 'make'
    and wait for it to compile.

    <p>
    <p><li> <b>10 April 2002, uClibc 0.9.11 Released</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.11. This release is primarily focused on fixing the issues that
    have turned up since the last release.  Several bugs in the gcc wrapper
    have been fixed, allowing applications such as iproute2 and XFree86 to link properly.  
    Large file support has been improved, and a thread locking bug was
    fixed that could cause s*printf calls to deadlock when threading was
    enabled.  Several bugs were also fixed with the powerpc, h8300, m68k,
    sparc, and mips architecture support.  Many additional applications now
    compile and run perfectly and have been added to the <a
    href="uClibc-apps.html">working applications list</a> .
    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.11.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.

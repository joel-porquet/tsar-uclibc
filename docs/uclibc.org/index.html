<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller then the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on standard Linux and 
<a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for ARM, i386, h8300, m68k, mips, mipsel, PowerPC,
SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, then using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

    Since most applications work just fine with uClibc, we are especially

    at all or do not work properly with uClibc.

    <li> <b>28 May 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.1 toolchain</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting has released source code and a Makefile to build a
    gcc-3.1 toolchain that natively targets uClibc.  Additionally, the
    gcc-3.0.4 and gcc-2.95 toolchains have also been updated.  These toolchains
    make it easy to build uClibc based applications.  Source code can be
    downloaded <a href="downloads/toolchain/">here</a> and is now much smaller,
    since much of the needed binutils and gcc source code is now downloaded on
    demand.  To build the toolchain, simply grab the source, edit the Makefile
    to select where you would like the toolchain installed, and then run 'make'
    and wait for it to compile.

    <p>
    <p><li> <b>10 April 2002, uClibc 0.9.11 Released</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.11. This release is primarily focused on fixing the issues that
    have turned up since the last release.  Several bugs in the gcc wrapper
    have been fixed, allowing applications such as iproute2 and XFree86 to link properly.  
    Large file support has been improved, and a thread locking bug was
    fixed that could cause s*printf calls to deadlock when threading was
    enabled.  Several bugs were also fixed with the powerpc, h8300, m68k,
    sparc, and mips architecture support.  Many additional applications now
    compile and run perfectly and have been added to the <a
    href="uClibc-apps.html">working applications list</a> .
    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.11.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.

<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">


Here are a few things on the TODO list:
<ul>
    <li> Shared library support for all supported architectures.
	Currently, only x86, arm, powerpc, and mips have native
	shared library loader support.  Several additional architectures
	need to have their own shared library loader.
    <li> Shared library support for mmu-less systems has been completed
	by two separate companies, but has not been contributed back.
    <li> Someone (hopefully) needs to volunteer to take the
	<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/">LSB Test Suite</a>,
	pull out the C library testing stuff, and convert it
	(perl script, by hand, I don't care how) into a form
	that is usable without having it take over your entire
	system (i.e. similar to what is currently in the uClibc
	test suite).  This will be <em>enormously</em> helpful!
    <li> other things as I think of them.

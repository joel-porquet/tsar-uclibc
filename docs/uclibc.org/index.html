<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, than using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<p>

<h3>Mailing List Information</h3>

uClibc has a <a href="/lists/uclibc/">mailing list</a>.<br>
To subscribe, go and visit 
<a href="http://www.uclibc.org/mailman/listinfo/uclibc">this page</a>.

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

You might want to take a look at the 
<a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>
before asking questions on the mailing list...
    
    
<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

    <li> <b>27 August 2002, uClibc 0.9.15 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability 
    of uClibc 0.9.15.  This is release fixes a number of problems that have
    turned up since the last release.   The good news is that uClibc now 
    passes all tests in the perl 5.8 and Python 2.2.1 test suites, both with
    and without pthreads.  So without any further ado....
    <p>

    <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/uClibc-0.9.15.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">here</a>.
    <p>
    Have fun!

    <p>
    <li> <b>12 August 2002, uClibc 0.9.14 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is slightly less pleased then usual to announce the
    immediate availability of uClibc 0.9.14.  This is, unfortunately, a bugfix
    release intended to fix the couple of dumb things that slipped into the
    previous release.  Version 0.9.13 of uClibc would fail to compile when
    enabling both RPC and Pthreads.  There was also a problem with RPC thread
    local storage (but noone noticed since it didn't compile ;-).  Also, the
    thread locking in exit(), onexit() and atexit() was broken, and wasn't
    actually locking anything.   This release also fixes uClibc's gcc wrapper
    to use crtbeginS.o and crtendS.o when compiling PIC code, fixing a subtle
    bug (that was much less subtle on powerpc).  Finally, this release includes a
    few minor compile warning cleanups.

    <li> <b>12 August 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.1.1 toolchain released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released an updated native
    uClibc/gcc-3.1.1 toolchain.   This toolchain builds a real gcc cross
    compiler (i.e. not just a wrapper) and creates executables linked vs
    uClibc.  This toolchain has been (briefly) tested as working on x86, arm,
    mips, and arm7tdmi (uClinux).  This toolchain provides a number of
    improvements over previous releases.   In particular, Steven J. Hill found
    and fixes a number of "glibc-isms" in the libstdc++ math support which
    caused a number of math functions to be mapped to the non-standard named
    under GNU libc.   This release also includes greatly improved uClinux
    "elf2flt" support, and it now produces working flat binaries for my
    uClinux/arm7tdmi system.  The native uClibc/gcc-2.95 toolchain will be
    updated in a few days, and will include STLport which will allow that
    toolchain to also provide full C++ support.
    <p>

    This toolchain should make it easy for anyone to build uClibc based 
    applications.  <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/toolchain/">
    Source code can be downloaded here</a>. 
    Be aware that much of the needed source code will actually be downloaded on
    demand when you compile things.  To build the toolchain, simply
    grab the source, edit the Makefile to select where you would like
    the toolchain installed, run 'make', and then go watch TV, eat
    dinner, or visit with your friends while it compiles.  It takes
    about 15 minutes for Erik to compile the gcc-3.1.1 toolchain (w/C++ support)
    on his Athlon XP 1600 (not counting the time it takes to download
    source code).  Your results may vary...
    <p>

    <li> <b>9 August 2002, uClibc now mirrored on kernel.org!</b>
    <br>
    uClibc is now available from the kernel.org mirrors!  This should make
    uClibc downloads much faster.  The kernel.org mirrors will have all 
    uClibc release versions (everything but the daily snapshots).
    Here is a list of all the <a href="http://kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirror sites</a>.
    Just pick the closest mirror site, and then go to "/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/"
    to download uClibc.  For example, is you live the USA, you can go to
    <a href="http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">
    http://www.us.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/</a> to download the latest 
    uClibc release from a nice fast system.

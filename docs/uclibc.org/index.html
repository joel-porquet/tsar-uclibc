<TR><TD BGCOLOR="#eeeee0">

<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that glibc is
eating up too much space, you should consider using uClibc.  If you are
building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes of storage, than using
glibc may be a better choice...
<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<p>

<h3>Mailing List Information</h3>

uClibc has a <a href="/lists/uclibc/">mailing list</a>.<br>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

Before asking questions on the uClibc mailing list,
you might want to take a look at the 
<a href="FAQ.html">list of Frequently Asked Questions</a>
or 
you might want to search the mailing list archives...

<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

    <p>
    <li> <b>8 November 2002, uClibc 0.9.16 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.16.  This release adds full support (including a native shared
    library loader) for the CRIS architecture, contributed by Tobias Anderberg.
    Stefan Allius contributed a number of patches to fix the initialization
    order for shared library global constructors and destructors as well as a
    large number of SuperH fixes and cleanups.  uClibc now compiles with
    newer versions of gcc (i.e. RedHat 8.0).  Thanks to Christian Michon,
    uClibc no longer requires perl to compile.  Steven J. Hill fixed dlopen for
    mips.  Several problems with pty and tty handling were fixed.  Manuel Novoa
    added new support for an /etc/TZ file to globally set the system timezone,
    and fixed up a number of remaining wide char issues.  Manuel is still hard
    at work on bringing full locale support (optional of course) to uClibc.
    And of course, this release includes the usual pile of bug fixes.  Many thanks
    for the large number of patches and fixes that were contributed!
    <p>

    Erik and Manuel have been working on a 
    <a href="downloads/Glibc_vs_uClibc_Differences.txt">
    document describing some of the differences between uClibc and glibc.</a>
    It's not yet 100% complete, and it hasn't been nicely formatted yet.  But
    it contains a lot of helpful information and is worth a look.
    <p>

    And finally, the the old uClibc configuration system has been completely
    removed (and there was much rejoicing).  It was replaced with an entirely
    new system based on <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~zippel/lc/">LinuxKernelConf</a>, 
    which has since been included into Linux 2.5.45, so it looks like Erik made 
    the right choice.  Of course, those who have existing build systems using uClibc 
    will need to make a few changes...  We think the change is worth it.
    <p>
    As usual, the 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/uClibc-0.9.16.tar.bz2">source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">here</a>.
    You might want to download uClibc from the closest 
    <a href="http://kernel.org/mirrors/">kernel.org mirror site</a>.
    Just pick the closest mirror site, and then go to 
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/">
    http://www.XX.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/</a>
    to download uClibc, where XX is your two letter country code.
    <p>
    Updated gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95 toolchains will be released shortly. 
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>16 September 2002, gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95 toolchains released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting (i.e. Erik) has released updated gcc-3.2 and gcc-2.95
    uClibc toolchains.  These toolchains build real gcc cross compilers (i.e.
    not just a wrapper) and create executables linked vs uClibc.   The new
    gcc-3.2 provides uClibc support with the latest and greatest compiler
    available from the gcc team.  The gcc-2.95 toolchain has been updated to
    the latest version of uClibc and now provides full C++ support, using the
    <a href="http://www.stlport.org/">STLport</a> standard C++ library.
    <p>

    This toolchain should make it easy for anyone to build uClibc based 
    applications.  <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/toolchain/">
    Source code can be downloaded here</a>. 
    Be aware that much of the needed source code will actually be downloaded on
    when you compile the toolchains.  To build a toolchain, simply
    grab the source, edit the Makefile to select where you would like
    the toolchain installed, run 'make', and then go watch TV, eat
    dinner, or visit with your friends while it compiles.  It takes
    about 15 minutes for Erik to compile the gcc-3.2 toolchain (w/C++ support)
    on his Athlon XP 1600 (not counting the time it takes to download
    source code).

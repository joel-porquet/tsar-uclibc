<a href="http://www.uclibc.org">uClibc</a> (aka µClibc/pronounced
yew-see-lib-see) is a C library for developing embedded Linux systems.
It is much smaller than the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/libc.html">GNU C Library</a>,
but nearly all applications supported by glibc also work perfectly with
uClibc. Porting applications from glibc to uClibc typically involves
just recompiling the source code. uClibc even supports shared libraries
and threading.  It currently runs on <a href="http://kernel.org/">standard Linux</a> 
and <a href="http://www.uclinux.org">MMU-less (also known as µClinux)</a>
systems with support for alpha, ARM, cris, i386, i960, h8300, m68k, mips/mipsel, 
PowerPC, SH, SPARC, and v850 processors.
<p>

If you are building an embedded Linux system and you find that
glibc is eating up too much space, you should consider using
uClibc.  If you are building a huge fileserver with 12 Terabytes
of storage, then using glibc may make more sense.  Unless, for
example, that 12 Terabytes will be Network Attached Storage and
you plan to burn Linux into the system's firmware...

<p>

uClibc is maintained by 
<a href="http://www.codepoet.org/andersen/erik/erik.html">Erik Andersen</a>
and is licensed under the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</a>
.  This license allows you to make closed source commercial applications using 
uClibc (Please consider sharing some of the money you make ;-).  You do not need 
to give away all your source code just because you use uClibc and/or run on Linux.

<h3>Working Applications List</h3>

    These days, pretty much everything compiles with uClibc.  This
    is a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> that are known 
    to work just fine with uClibc.  Since most applications work just 
    fine with uClibc, we are especially interested in knowing about any 
    applications that either <em>do not compile</em> or <em>do not work</em> 
    properly with uClibc.  Submissions are welcome!

    <p>
    <li> <b>30 September 2003, dev systems updated to uClibc 0.9.21+</b>
    <br>

    The uClibc development systems for
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_i386.bz2">i386</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_arm.bz2">arm</a>,
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/root_fs_mipsel.bz2">mips</a>,
    have been updated to uClibc 0.9.21 (plus all the CVS updates up to
    today).  Several problems have been fixed up,
    gcc has been updated to version 3.3.1, binutils was updated, and
    <em>tada</em> everything finally works for cross compiling.  These were
    all cross compiled (which really makes things faster since the older
    mipsel releases used to take 2 days to build!)

    <p>
    This is an ~100 MB ext2 filesystem that runs natively on the specified
    architecture.  It contains all the development software you need to build
    your own uClibc applications, including bash, coreutils, findutils,
    diffutils, patch, sed, ed, flex, bison, file, gawk, tar, grep gdb, strace,
    make, gcc, g++,  autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh perl, 
    and more.   And of course, everything is dynamically linked against uClibc.  
    By using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  If you want to quickly get started with testing or using
    uClibc you should give these images a try.  You can loop mount and them
    you can chroot into them, you can boot into with using user-mode Linux, 
    and you can even 'dd' them to a spare partition and use resize2fs to make 
    them fill the drive.  Whatever works for you.

    <p> If you would like to build your own custom uClibc system, you can
	use <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a>, which is
	how these uClibc development systems were created.
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>9 September 2003, uClibc 0.9.21 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.21.  This release has been brewing for several months now, and
    provides quite a lot of additional functionality and quite a few bug fixes
    as well.  Many people will be pleased that this release fixes the
    "dlopen()'ing libraries that depend on libraries" problem.

    <p>
    
    The biggest thing in this release (and I do mean that literally) is that
    uClibc now has full ANSI/ISO C99 locale support.  Well, except for
    wcsftime() and collating items in regex, which are not done yet.   Adding
    support for the default set of locales (169 UTF-8 locales and 144 locales
    using other codesets) will enlarge uClibc by around 300k.  Still, if you
    need locale support, that is still much better than the roughly 30MB the
    comparable set of locale date occupies with glibc.  And you can of course
    reduce the 300k by reducing the number of supported locales.

    <p>

    As usual, this release has many improvements, both large and small.  At
    this point, most applications that compile and work with glibc will also
    compile and run with uClibc.  Both Perl and Python pass all the tests in
    their test suites (both with and without locale support enabled).  We
    invite you to grab a copy of the latest <a
    href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/"> Linux Test Project test suite</a> and
    give uClibc some abuse.  We are not yet perfect, but we are getting pretty
    darn close.

    <p>
    
    This release is not binary compatible with earlier releases.  Depending on
    your configuration, you may actually still be binary compatible, but it
    would be a good idea to recompile your applications when moving to the
    uClibc 0.9.21 release.  We are sorry about that, but we have never promised
    to provide binary compatibility until we hit version 1.0.  And even then,
    if you change your uClibc configuration, you still still generally need to
    recompile...

    <p>

    As usual, the 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>, 
    <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/Changelog.full">detailed changelog</a>, 
    and <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/uClibc-0.9.21.tar.bz2">source code for this release</a> 
    are available <a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/">here</a>.

    <p>

    Updated uClibc development systems using uClibc 0.9.21 will be made
    available within a few days.

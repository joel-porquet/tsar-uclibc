    <li> <b>10 April 2002, Native uClibc/gcc-3.0.4 toolchain</b>
    <br>
    CodePoet Consulting has released source code and a Makefile
    to build a gcc-3.0.4 toolchain that natively targets uClibc.
    This brings with it full C++ support for uClibc, including the 
    libstdc++ library.  A gcc-2.95.x toolchain will also be released 
    shortly, but is not yet ready.  At this time, only source code and
    a Makefile for the native uClibc toolchain is being released (i.e.
    no binaries, sorry).  Source code can be downloaded 
    <a href="downloads/toolchain/">here</a>,
    but be aware that the source code is 27 MB.
    <p>
    To build the toolchain, simply grab the source, edit the Makefile
    to select where you would like the toolchain installed.  Then
    run 'make' and wait for it to compile.  If you do not have a copy
    of uClibc already, it will download the latest daily snapshot.


    <p>
    <li> <b>21 March 2002, uClibc 0.9.10 Released!</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.10. This release adds pthreads support
    (including pthreads support for mmu-less systems!).  Additionally,
    thanks to Manuel Novoa III, we now have a completely new stdio
    library, which is small, standards compliant, supports pthreads,
    wide/narrow streams, large files, and can even operate in a
    low-memory unbuffered mode.  Many, many bugs have been fixed and a
    number of additional applications now compile and run perfectly.
    Even with all these changes, uClibc continues to be very small.
    On x86, a default build of the uClibc C library is still just 168k.

    <p>

    To make things more interesting, the release also adds support for
    C++ constructors and destructors.  To make it easy to use uClibc
    when developing C++ applications, this release also provides a 
    wrapper for the GNU C++ compiler.  Of course, for more complex C++
    applications, such as those using iostreams, a standard C++ library
    (libstdc++) is required.  A native GNU toolchain (binutils/gcc) that
    provides libstdc++ linked with uClibc 0.9.10 will be released in the
    next couple of days, so stay tuned.

    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.10.tar.bz2">Source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>


    <p>
    <li> <b>4 February 2002, uClibc 0.9.9 Released!</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate
    availability of uClibc 0.9.9.  With this release,
    <a href="uClibc-apps.html">just about 
    everything we have tested now compiles and runs</a>.  In fact,
    there are now so many programs on the working application list that 
    rather than continue to add to this list, from now on we 
    will only be adding applications to the <em>not working list</em>.  Most applications 
    on the <em>not working list</em> either require pthreads, or require 
    wide-character support.  Work on wide-character support is
    well underway, and will hopefully be moving into CVS in the next week or
    two.  Full pthreads support and rentrancy are on the TODO list
    and are expected to be complete in the next couple of months.
    <p>
    The <a href="downloads/Changelog">Changelog</a>
    and <a
    href="downloads/uClibc-0.9.9.tar.bz2">Source code</a> 
    for this release are available <a href="downloads/">here</a>.
    <p>
    One final bit on news -- as some of you may have noticed, uclibc.org 
    has been a bit overloaded and somewhat slow recently.  The server should 
    be getting colocated tomorrow, which will eliminate the speed problem.  
    During the move, there may be some temporary disruption of service...
    <p>
    Have Fun!

    <p>
    <li> <b>22 December 2001, uClibc 0.9.8 Released!</b>
    <br>

    After many months of initial development, we are pleased to announce the
    release of uClibc 0.9.8.  This release should be quite solid, and is very
    usable.  This also, hopefully, marks a transition from a slow incubation
    phase to a more methodical release cycle.  From now one, there should be
    approximately one release per month.
    <p>
    The source code for this release is available
	<a href="downloads/">here</a>.


    <p>
    <li> <b>26 November 2001, powerpc shared libraries fully working</b>
    <br>
    Dave Schleef finished off the the work needed for shared library support on
    powerpc.  There had been a few problems remaining, and those are now squashed.
    So shared libs on powerpc should be working fully now.

    <p>
    <li> <b>14 November 2001, m68 compiles again, Large file support working</b>
    <br>
	About a month ago I synced the header files with glibc 2.2.4 for better
	C++ support and better standards compliance.  I forgot to sync up m68k,
	sparc, powerpc, and mipsel.  Dave Schleef fixed powerpc while he was fixing
	up the shared lib loader.  I just fixed up m68k, sparc, and mipsel so they
	should all compile again.
	<p>
	I also finished up fixing large file support (just enable DOLFS in your
	Config file to enable it) and it is working just great, and greatly increases
	the number of glibc applications that will work "out-of-the-tarball" without
	needing any changes.


    <li> <b>12 November 2001, powerpc shared lib support</b>
    <br>
	Thanks to David Schleef, uClibc now has full shared library support 
	on powerpc.  This brings full shared library support to x86, ARM, and 
	now powerpc.  Thanks Dave!


    <p>
    <li> <b>7 November 2001, uClibc application list</b>
    <br>
	uClibc now has a <a href="uClibc-apps.html">list of applications</a> 
	that are known to work.  If you have any applications to add to the
	list, submissions are welcome!


    <p>
    <li> <b>18 October 2001, buildroot uClibc example system</b>
    <br>

	Those wanting an easy way to test out uClibc and give it
	a test drive can download and compile 
	<a href="http://www.uclibc.org/downloads/buildroot.tar.gz">buildroot.tar.gz</a>.   This
	is a nifty buildsystem that will automagically download and build
	a <a href="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net/">User-Mode Linux</a>
	kernel, and will then download source for and compile up a fully
	working uClibc based root filesystem.  This should make it easy for
	people to create their own projects.  I hope that this build system
	will allow people to more easily use and build uClibc based systems.
	As an example of how nicely this works, the 
	<a href="http://tuxscreen.net/">Tuxscreen Project</a> is using a
	<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tuxscreen/buildroot-tux/">slightly adjusted variant of the buildroot system</a> to cross 
	compile the blob bootloader, linux kernel, and a uClibc based jffs2
	root filesystem (busybox, tinylogin, udhcp, lrzsz, pcmcia-cs and 
	microwindows) for ARM.  Pretty cool.



    <p>
    <li> <b>11 October 2001, v850 architecture support</b>
    <br>

	Miles Bader has contributed support for the v850 architecture.


    <p>
    <li> <b>25 Spetember 2001, header files updated</b>
    <br>

	uClibc's header files are now in sync with glibc 2.2.4,
    allowing better standards compliance, better portibility, and 
    better C++ support.
    
    <p>
    <li> <b>4 July 2001, ARM shared library support</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has full shared library support on ARM.


    <p>
    <li> <b>9 May 2001, libm added</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has a very complete math library.


    <p>
    <p> <li> <b>9 May 2001, ld.so added</b>
    <br>

	uClibc now has a native ld.so.  It currently is only ported to work on x86,
	but porting to other architectures should not be too difficult.


    <p> <li> <b>15 March 2001, powerpc port added</b>
    <br>

	David Schleef contributed a powerpc port, which is now in CVS.

    <p> <li> <b>19 February 2001, SH port added</b>
    <br>

	Jean-Yves Avenard contributed an SH port.  See his email 
	with the initial patch <a href="/lists/uclibc/2001-February/000409.html">here</a>.

    <p> <li> <b>16 January 2001, uClibc as a shared library</b>
    <br>

	 As if January 16, uClibc can now be used (at least on x86) as a shared
	library.  See the <a href="/lists/uclibc/2001-January/000126.html">email</a>
	announcing this achievement.

    <p> <li> <b>11 January 2001, gcc wrapper added</b>
    <br>

	Manuel Novoa III has created a wrapper for gcc that makes compiling apps vs uClibc
	as simple as just setting "CC" to gcc-uClibc-&lt arch&gt.  This even works when cross
	compiling!  Very cool.

    <p> <li> <b>3 January 2001, uClibc now has a web page</b>
    <br>

	 A lot of work has been going on under the hood with uClibc,
	 so I decided to put together this webpage to let the world know
	 that it exists and is getting to be very usable.

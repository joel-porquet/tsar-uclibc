    <li> <b>13 November 2003, uClibc 0.9.23 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.23.  Of course, we are somewhat less than pleased that there
    were configuration problems in the previous release that made such it
    necessary to release .23 so quickly.  Updated uClibc development systems
    using uClibc 0.9.23 are being built and will be posted shortly.  And Erik
    has built Debian stable (woody) for x86 with uClibc and it runs great.

    <p>
    
    This release continues to be binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21 and
    0.9.22 -- as long as you pick compatible configuration options.  Enabling
    or disabling things like soft-float, locale, wide char support, or changing
    cpu optimizations are all good examples of binary incompatible
    configuration options.  If have changed any of those sorts of options (or
    if you are not sure!) you will need to recompile all your applications and
    libraries.

    <li> <b>8 November 2003, uClibc 0.9.22 Released</b>
    <br>

    CodePoet Consulting is pleased to announce the immediate availability of
    uClibc 0.9.22.  This release has been cooking for a couple of months now
    and is looking quite solid.  We have done quite a lot of testing with this
    release and things are looking good.  And Erik has built Debian stable
    (woody) for x86 with uClibc and it runs great.  Expect that to be released
    in the next few days.

    <p>
    
    This release is binary compatible with uClibc 0.9.21 -- as long as you pick
    compatible configuration options.  Enabling or disabling things like

    changed any of those sorts of options (or if you are not sure!) you will
    need to recompile all your applications and libraries.

    <p>

    Updated uClibc development systems using uClibc 0.9.22 will be made
    available within a few days.  Meanwhile, we invite you to try out uClibc
    with the latest <a href="http://ltp.sourceforge.net/">Linux Test Project
    test suite</a> (you will need to apply a small <a
    href="http://www.uclibc.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/sources/ltp-testsuite.patch?rev=1.3">patch</a>.
    And also give the latest Perl and Python test suites a try as well.
    If you find any bugs in uClibc, PLEASE let us know!

    <li> <b>30 September 2003, dev systems updated to uClibc 0.9.21+</b>
    <br>

    The uClibc development systems for
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_i386.bz2">i386</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_powerpc.bz2">powerpc</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_arm.bz2">arm</a>,
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/uclibc/root_fs_mipsel.bz2">mips</a>,
    have been updated to uClibc 0.9.21 (plus all the CVS updates up to
    today).  Several problems have been fixed up,
    gcc has been updated to version 3.3.1, binutils was updated to 2.14.90.0.6, and
    <em>tada</em> everything finally works for cross compiling.  These were
    all cross compiled (which really makes things faster since the older
    mipsel releases used to take 2 days to build!)

    <p>
    These are ~100 MB ext2 filesystems that run natively on the specified
    architecture.  They contains all the development software you need to build
    your own uClibc applications, including bash, coreutils, findutils,
    diffutils, patch, sed, ed, flex, bison, file, gawk, tar, grep gdb, strace,
    make, gcc, g++,  autoconf, automake, ncurses, zlib, openssl, openssh perl, 
    and more.   And of course, everything is dynamically linked against uClibc.  
    By using a uClibc only system, you can avoid all the painful
    cross-configuration problems that have made using uClibc somewhat painful
    in the past.  If you want to quickly get started with testing or using
    uClibc you should give these images a try.  You can loop mount and them
    you can chroot into them, you can boot into with using user-mode Linux, 
    and you can even 'dd' them to a spare partition and use resize2fs to make 
    them fill the drive.  Whatever works for you.

    <p> If you would like to build your own custom uClibc system, you can
	use <a href="/cgi-bin/cvsweb/buildroot/">buildroot</a>, which is
	how these uClibc development systems were created.

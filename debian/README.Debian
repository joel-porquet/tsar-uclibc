Notes about building:

The script mksnapshot will automatically download a new snapshot
from the uClibc CVS server.  This uses the uclinux.org anonymous
CVS repository, which is a read-only mirror of the actual upstream
repository.

Building depends on the kernel-source-2.4.18 package.  Doing this
is really the most convenient way of getting kernel headers, and
it works consistently on all architectures.

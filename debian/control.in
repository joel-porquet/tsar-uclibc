Macros used:
CROSS - defined if we are building cross compiling packages.  This does
  not mean that we are cross-building _this_ package.
_HOST_ - suffix for the arch we are compiling
_TARGET_ - suffix for the arch that the package will target

Description: A small implementation of the C library
 uClibc is an implementation of the standard C library that is
 much smaller than glibc, which makes it useful for embedded
 systems.

 This is a small wrapper for gcc, ld, and other toolchain utilities
 to do compilation against uClibc instead of the native libc.

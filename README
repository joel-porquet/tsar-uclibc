* Configuration:

  cp ./extra/Configs/Config.<target arch> ./Config

Then edit ./Config for your setup.  In particular, modify CROSS and
KERNEL_SOURCE as necessary.  You may also want to modify
SHARED_LIB_LOADER_PATH, DEVEL_PREFIX, and SYSTEM_DEVEL_PREFIX depending
on where you want to install the development environment.  By default,
the development environment is installed into /usr/<arch>-linux-uclibc/.


* Building:

  make


* Installing the development environment:

(As root, if necessary,)

  make install

This will install the header files, libraries, and the gcc
wrapper into the directories defined in Config.


* Installing the target runtime environment:

(As root, if necessary,)

   make PREFIX=<temporary path> install_target

This installs only the files that are necessary to run binaries
compiled against uClibc.  Hint: You probably do not want to install
the target runtime environment on your host machine.


* Using uClibc:

To compile programs with uClibc,

   export PATH={uClibc DEVEL_PREFIX}/bin:$PATH

and then just ./configure and make as usual.

Note: You may also want to look at extra/gcc-uclibc/gcc-uclibc.c for
      additional information concerning what options and environment
      variables the gcc wrapper handles.

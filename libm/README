Programs for Mathematical Functions_ (Prentice-Hall, 1989) or
from the Cephes Mathematical Library, a commercial product. In
either event, it is copyrighted by the author.  What you see here

   The two known misprints in the book are repaired here in the
source listings for the gamma function and the incomplete beta
integral.

This archive includes all the programs in the /netlib/cephes directory
on research.att.com as of 17 Nov 92.  The file "index" will tell you in
what directory and file each function can be found.  If there is
something else mentioned in cephes.doc that you need, you can check
research.att.com to see whether it has been added.  Failing that, you
can contact Stephen Moshier.
